From the base code, I changed the number of items to randomly be between 5 and 30, instead of 5 and 20.
I also randomized the arrival time of customers so that it randomly chose a number between 1 and 3 minutes.
I also changed the number of checkers from 5 to 3
Lastly I changed the time of the simulation from 180 minutes to 360 minutes

I learned how the changing the variable will effect most everything. I first increased numbers around the simulation like 
the number of items and the time of the simulation. My goal was then to find the most efficient wait time and idle time 
combination. I used 5 checkers as my control group and then found that the optimal number of checkers was either 2 or 3.
With 2, I had a lot less idle time, but the wait time was consistantly above 3 minutes. with 3 checkers there was much more
idle time, but wait times were always under 3 minutes. This helped me understand independent variables and how the effect the
dependent variable.
